Not a framework but a library just to make UI as it doesnt handle any routing
React is declarative ie tell it what to do dont think how does it do and it will do it for u ie updating the DOM and rendering
React is responsible for making SPA ie serving only 1 html file ie index.html and then using JS to make changes to the DOM
index.html is served inside which root div is present which is the parent of all the components under which the app is rendered through index.js
index.js renders app component onto the root div and app component renders all the other components
